# ASL-Translator
American Sign Language (ASL) is a complete, natural language that has the same linguistic properties as spoken languages, with grammar that differs from English. ASL is expressed by movements of the hands and face. It is the primary language of many North Americans who are deaf and hard of hearing, and is used by many hearing people as well.

In this project we make our machine learn all the 26 Alphabets by using SVM. The code is in Python Language and using numpy and openCV.
